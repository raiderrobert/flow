# Concurrency & Async

## Core Question

**Is this CPU-bound or I/O-bound, and what's the sharing model?**

## Error → Design Question

| Error | Don't Just Say | Ask Instead |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| E0277 Send | "Add Send bound" | Should this type cross threads? |
| E0277 Sync | "Wrap in Mutex" | Is shared access really needed? |
| Future not Send | "Use spawn_local" | Is async the right choice? |
| Deadlock | "Reorder locks" | Is the locking design correct? |

## Decision Flowchart

```
What type of work?
├─ CPU-bound → std::thread or rayon
├─ I/O-bound → async/await (tokio)
└─ Mixed → hybrid (spawn_blocking)

Need to share data?
├─ No → message passing (channels)
├─ Immutable → Arc<T>
└─ Mutable →
   ├─ Read-heavy → Arc<RwLock<T>>
   ├─ Write-heavy → Arc<Mutex<T>>
   └─ Simple counter → AtomicUsize

Async context?
├─ Type is Send → tokio::spawn
├─ Type is !Send → spawn_local
└─ Blocking code → spawn_blocking
```

## Send/Sync Markers

| Marker | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Send` | Can transfer ownership between threads | Most types |
| `Sync` | Can share references between threads | `Arc<T>` |
| `!Send` | Must stay on one thread | `Rc<T>` |
| `!Sync` | No shared refs across threads | `RefCell<T>` |

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Thread-Safe | Blocking | Use When |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| `std::thread` | Yes | Yes | CPU-bound parallelism |
| `async/await` | Yes | No | I/O-bound concurrency |
| `Mutex<T>` | Yes | Yes | Shared mutable state |
| `RwLock<T>` | Yes | Yes | Read-heavy shared state |
| `mpsc::channel` / `crossbeam::channel` | Yes | Optional | Message passing |
| `Arc<Mutex<T>>` | Yes | Yes | Shared mutable across threads |

## Async-Specific Patterns

### Avoid MutexGuard Across Await

```rust
// Bad: guard held across await
let guard = mutex.lock().await;
do_async().await;  // guard still held!

// Good: scope the lock
{
    let guard = mutex.lock().await;
    // use guard
}  // guard dropped
do_async().await;
```

### Non-Send Types in Async

```rust
// Rc is !Send, can't cross await in spawned task
// Option 1: use Arc instead
// Option 2: use spawn_local (single-thread runtime)
// Option 3: ensure Rc is dropped before .await
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| E0277 `Send` not satisfied | Non-Send in async | Use Arc or spawn_local |
| E0277 `Sync` not satisfied | Non-Sync shared | Wrap with Mutex |
| Deadlock | Lock ordering | Consistent lock order |
| `future is not Send` | Non-Send across await | Drop before await |
| `MutexGuard` across await | Guard held during suspend | Scope guard properly |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Better |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Arc\<Mutex\<T\>\> everywhere | Contention, complexity | Message passing |
| thread::sleep in async | Blocks executor | tokio::time::sleep |
| Holding locks across await | Blocks other tasks | Scope locks tightly |
| Ignoring deadlock risk | Hard to debug | Lock ordering, try_lock |
| Mutex for single-thread | Unnecessary overhead | RefCell |
| std::sync::Mutex in async | Blocks executor | tokio::sync::Mutex |
